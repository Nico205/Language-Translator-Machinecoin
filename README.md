Language-Translator-Machinecoin
===============================

This script generate a machinecoin community kit website in all languages which are defined and their file is located in the "lang" folder. The output is finished within some seconds :)

**Usage: "php lang.php language_code_or_all template_name_or_all"**

If everthing working correcly there should be no output in the terminal but the generated files are located under "_site".




**This script is free-to-use so everybody can port this to their own website without asking me for permission. It would be nice if you can sent me your website as a example for other users.**
